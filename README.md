## What is Classroom?

Classroom is a rather simple application built for teachers/instructors/professors alike. The main features include: 

- the ability to create an account as a teacher/instructor/professor 
- add courses to your dashboard
- add students to those courses
- add grades to those students

Those grades are then calculated into an average.

The average for each student will include a different colored flag/marker based on where their average falls in terms of an A, B, C, D, or F.

Individual grades will also recieve a flag/marker based on their letter grade.

These flags/markers help teachers determine things like:

- what students may be falling behind and need more assistance
- which assignments in particular are giving the most students trouble 

&nbsp;

## Goal

The overall goal of Classroom is to provide teachers, instructors, and professors with a way to monitor their students grades and ensure their success.
